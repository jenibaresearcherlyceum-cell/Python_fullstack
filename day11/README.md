Day 11 - Authentication & Role Concepts

## Concepts Covered
- Authentication:
    -->Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.
    -->It checks whether the username and password are correct.
    -->Example: Login system.

- Authorization:
     -->Authorization decides what a user is allowed to do after login.
     -->Example:
           *Admin can delete employees.
           *Staff can only view data.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
      -->RBAC is a method where access is given based on user roles.
      -->Common roles:
                 *Admin
                 *Staff
             ->Each role has different permissions.

- Why Plain Text Passwords Are Insecure?
        -->If passwords are stored as plain text:
        -->Anyone can read them easily.
